This repository contains a CloudFormation template to spin up a Jupyter environment on AWS (optionally with CUDA support if using the g2 instance family)

It also contains a number of Jupyter notebooks as examples.

There will be a number of labs available here in the future too which will be provided as interactive Jupyter notebooks.

Enjoy!
